# Enel X Intercharge QR Code Converter

Since the selection of the charging station in the Enel X Way app has sometimes driven me crazy, I have created a small website to solve the problem. The website creates you the correct EnelXWay suitable EVSE ID, so you can copy it.

## Use

## Install

### iOS

Access the website on safari, click the share button and add the website to your homescreen.
